You will learn several applications of the integral by finding volume of solids, arc-length of curves, and solving exponential growth and decay problems. In this course, we will learn about infinite sequences and series (which is an infinite list of numbers and an infinite sum of numbers). We will learn what it means for these things to converge and diverge, and we will learn a variety of tests to check this. Again, much like integration techniques, we will learn these tests separately but the main goal is to learn when it is appropriate to apply each test. Our final unit of the course will be looking at parametric equations. This is something that helps model a large variety of scenarios we encounter in many of the sciences. We will learn what these equations look like and how to do some familiar calculus with these types of equations.',

This course aims to develop critical  thinking skills by introducing students to a set of principles for assessing when we do have good  reasons and when we don’t. In studying these principles, we will use the media (including social  media) as a case study running throughout the entire course. But the principles themselves apply  much more widely – for instance, to academic reading and writing, business, politics, and social  interactions. Therefore, the course is not focused on a particular academic discipline. Instead, it  develops key analytic skills that will serve students well in a wide variety of both academic and  non-academic contexts. Topics to be covered include argument, deductive and inductive  reasoning, common mistakes in reasoning, bias, experts, and scientific reasoning. All of these  topics will be treated informally and non-technically, with a focus on ordinary language and  familiar situations.

Its guiding theme is Kant’s attempt to vindicate the idea that metaphysics provides us with a special kind of non-empirical knowledge. Kant is convinced that (i) any genuinely philosophical  knowledge is metaphysical knowledge; (ii) the very possibility of such knowledge is called into doubt by  prevalent conceptions of the human mind (such as those of Descartes, Locke, Leibniz, and Hume); and  (iii) assuaging this doubt (and thus vindicating metaphysical knowledge) requires a careful analysis of  human cognitive capacities. In this course we study the account of our cognitive capacities that Kant  proposes and ask whether he succeeds in vindicating metaphysical knowledge. In particular, we consider  Kant’s claim that the two most basic capacities, sense-perception and conceptual thought, are distinct in  nature and yet are required to cooperate in a particular way if there is to be any knowledge at all. In  considering this claim we will discuss the following topics: spatial representation; concepts; the relation  between empirical knowledge and a priori knowledge; self-consciousness; causality; idealism; and free  will. The focus will be on a close study of Kant’s text.',

Ranging geographically in the Mediterranean from Turkey to Sicily and historically from the 6th to the 5th centuries BCE, they were united by the Greek language and a shared methodology of rationally explaining the world by means of its own inherent natural principles. These thinkers, sometimes misleadingly called ‘Presocratics’ (some were contemporaries of Socrates), were the first recognizable natural scientists and philosophers in the Western tradition. By originating naturalistic, rational and explanatory accounts of the world, these thinkers shaped the kinds of questions, answers and methods employed in subsequent philosophical and scientific inquiry up to and including the present day. Among the thinkers whose views we will examine are: Thales, Anaximander, Anaximenes, Xenophanes, Parmenides, Zeno, Pythagoras, Heraclitus, Democritus and Leucippus, Anaxagoras, and Empedocles.
